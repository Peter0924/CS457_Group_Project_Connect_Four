# Connect Four Game with Real-Time Chat

This project is a **Connect Four** game implemented in Python, with an added real-time chat feature. Players can compete in the classic game of Connect Four while communicating with each other during gameplay.

## Features

- **Real-Time Chat**: Players can send messages to each other during the game.
- **Turn-Based Gameplay**: Alternating turns ensure only the current player can make a move.
- **Game State Synchronization**: The server maintains a consistent game state across all connected clients.
- **Player Identification**: Each player has a unique username, making it easy to track moves and chat messages.
- **Automatic Victory Detection**: The server detects when a player connects four discs and announces the winner.
- **Reset and Restart Functionality**: Players can restart the game after a round is completed.
- **Intuitive UI with Pygame**: A simple and interactive game board and chat interface, built using Pygame.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **Sockets**: For real-time communication between the server and clients.
- **Pygame**: For the game board and user interface.

## How to Set Up and Run

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but Recommended)

To isolate the projectâ€™s dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
```

Activate the virtual environment:

- **Windows**: `venv\Scripts\activate`
- **Mac/Linux**: `source venv/bin/activate`

### 2. Install Dependencies
Ensure you have Python (3.6 or later) installed:

```bash
module load python/bundle-3.6

```

Ensure you have Pygame installed:

```bash
pip install pygame

```

### 3. Start the Server

In a terminal, start the server:

```bash
python server.py -p <PORT>

```
Replace <PORT> with the desired port number, e.g., 12345.<br>
Server IP defaults to 127.0.0.1.

### 4. Start the Client

In separate terminals, start the client for each player:

```bash
python client.py -i <SERVER_IP> -p <PORT>

```

Replace <SERVER_IP> with the server's IP address and <PORT> with the port number you used for the server.

### 5. Play the Game

- **Join the Game**: Each player enters a username upon connecting.
- **Take Turns**: Players take turns selecting a column (0-6) to drop their disc.
- **Win the Game**: The first player to connect four discs in a row (vertically, horizontally, or diagonally) wins!
- **Chat with Players**: Players can use the chat feature at any time during the game.
- **Restart**: After a round ends, players can click the "New Game" button to reset the board and start over.

## Game Rules

1. **Connect Four**: Players take turns dropping discs into columns. The disc falls to the lowest available row in that column.
2. **Victory Condition**: A player wins by connecting four discs in a row vertically, horizontally, or diagonally.
3. **Draw Condition**: If all grid spaces are filled and no player has connected four, the game ends in a draw.
4. **Chat Feature**: Players can communicate with each other in real-time using the chat feature.

## Shutting Down

- **Server Shutdown**: Type `shutdown` in the server terminal or press `CTRL + C` to terminate the server.
- **Client Exit**: Type `quit` in the client terminal to exit the game or click quit button to exit the game.

## Brief roadmap of where you would take the project

1. **Advanced UI with Web Integration**: Replace the Pygame interface with a web-based UI using modern frameworks like React. This would enable more flexibility and a better user experience.
2. **Matchmaking and Player Lobby**: Introduce a feature for creating and joining game lobbies, enabling players to find and compete with others online.
3. **AI Opponent**: Add a single-player mode where users can play against a AI with adjustable difficulty levels.
4. **Leaderboards and Statistics**: Track and display player stats, including wins, losses, and ties, in a persistent leaderboard.
5. **Enhanced Chat Features**: Add emojis, message notifications, and group chat capabilities for a richer communication experience.

## Retrospective on Overall Project

### What Went Right

Overall, there were plenty of things that went right during this semester-long project. Initially, our plan was to create a fun, interactive, easy-to-play, connect four game using python, sockets, and pygame. In the end, we were able to successfully implement the core gameplay mechanics required for a connect four game between two players, and created a solid framework that synchronized game state across both clients. We were able to also introduce a variety of features, including real-time communication between players which used a chat/textbox function. On top of all of that, we went one step beyond and made sure to implement a user interface that really made the game come together. This was created with the use of pygame. All in all, we're pretty happy with what we acomplished for our connect four game project.

- Successfully implemented core gameplay mechanics and synchronized game state across clients.
- Real-time communication and chat functionality worked as intended.
- The Pygame-based interface provides a functional and intuitive experience for players.

### What Could Be Improved On

Due to the nature of a class project and only having a semester to work on it, there will of course still be things that could be improved on in the future. Firstly, we would implement encryption for our players to make sure that the game is secure and safe to play. This is important, especially for an online game. As an online game, we would also like to introduce some more intensive scalability for multiplayer compatibility, introducing the option to host multiple games on a server at once. We also believe that the current UI, although great, can be improved on in the future. Creating new UI elements that are not only integral to gameplay, but provide a more visually appealing look, would be our first priority. We might also consider transitioning to a more web browser focused interface, as we believe our game would be perfect for such an environment. Finally, the never ending battle against bugs and errors wouldn't slow down. To combat this, we would extensively review our current error handling methods, and make sure that anything that could possibly disrupt the player experience is accounted for. Overall, there are a lot of things we can improve on going forward, yet we are still fulfilled with the game's current state.

- The current UI can be improved to make it more visually appealing and user-friendly, potentially by transitioning to a web-based interface.
- The game lacks scalability for hosting multiple games or players simultaneously.
- Error handling could be further refined for better resilience to unexpected scenarios.
